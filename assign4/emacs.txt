3. the differences between your repository and the one in 
~eggert/src/gnu/emacs: On my repository downloaded from Savannah, there is only 
one branch, the "master" branch; however, in ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs, there are 
179 branches. Actually, my repository downloaded is not a working directory of 
emacs, but only a copied repository as an emacs user. However, 
~eggert/src/gnu/emacs is actually a git repository for those who actually 
maintain and modify emacs like Prof. Eggert.
