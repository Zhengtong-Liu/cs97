1. This commit is a merge between commits ffd201c47e  and 18c0e20bea, with 
author Glenn Morris, and the commit was made 2020-20-17 09:48:54 (-0700 time 
zone). It was described as a merge from origin/emacs-27 branch. The merged 
point is also visualized in the left upper window, since two nodes merge at 
this point.

There are three windows on the top of the screen:
	the left one shows the graph of the commits history(with each commit as 
a node, and the merge commit merges two line together) with brief commits 
messages, the middle one is the author name and author email corresponding to 
each commit, the right one displays the commit time.

In the middle of the screen, there are some options like searching a commit by 
its SHAI ID.


At the bottom of the screen, there are mainly two windows:
	the left one shows the detailed commit message, and I can view the 
diff, old version or new version. On the right, there are options to view the 
patch or the tree.

3. the differences between your repository and the one in 
~eggert/src/gnu/emacs: On my repository downloaded from Savannah, there is only 
one branch, the "master" branch; however, in ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs, there are 
179 branches. Actually, my repository downloaded is not a working directory of 
emacs, but only a copied repository as an anonymous user. However, 
~eggert/src/gnu/emacs is actually a git repository for those who actually 
maintain and modify emacs like Prof. Eggert.
